    <h3>About Us</h3>
        <p>For tourists who looking to rent a place to stay during a vacation 
            or event. AirHome is an application that allows users to find 
            suitable housing based on trip requirements such as pricing, 
            distance from specified address, & housing conditions by 
            offering a list of recommended homes. Unlike other vacational
            rental applications, that charge overpriced fees, our service 
            is affordable with flexible rates and an easy to navigate interface.
