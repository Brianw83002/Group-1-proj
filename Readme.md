## Project Vision:
For tourists who looking to rent a place to stay during a vacation or event. 
AirHome is an application that allows users to find suitable housing based on trip 
requirements such as pricing, distance from specified address, & housing conditions
by offering a list of recommended homes. Unlike other vacational rental applications,
that charge overpriced fees, our service is affordable with flexible rates and an easy
to navigate interface.
